We have developed a tool to find a stealthy-attack vectors that tampers sensor/actuator data. These attack-vectors target various vulnerable points on Smart-Grid causing un-natural behavior without getting detected by anomaly detectors. We use a methodology that synthesizes attack vector using a learning-based probablistic engin and a stochastic optimization-based formal engine.
