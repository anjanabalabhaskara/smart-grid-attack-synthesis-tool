User Guide
===========

We have developed a tool to find stealthy-attack vectors that tamper the sensor and actuator data of Smart Grid. These attack vectors target specific components of the grid causing abnormal behavior like brown-outs, without getting discovered by the anomaly detectors prsent in the grid. We use a methodology that synthesizes attack vectors using a learning-based probabilistic engine and a stochastic optimization-based formal engine.
